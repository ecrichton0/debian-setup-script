# debian-setup-script

Very crude bash script to make Debian useful. For server use, installs some basic tools and optionally docker.

To use: 
- Install Debian and setup user account like normal
- Login as root or use 'su -'
- Install git by doing 'apt install git'
- Clone the repo
- Chmod to make the scripts executable
- Run the script

Tested working on Debian 12
